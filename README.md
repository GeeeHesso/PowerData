Power Data
==========

This repository contains a toolset for generating data for machine learning applications in power systems. It consists in two parts:

- [Time Series](./TimeSeries) is a Python module for generating realistic time series based on historical data.
- [Temperate Optimal Power Flow (TOPF)](./TemperateOptimalPowerFlow.jl) is a Julia framework for simulating a realistic dispatch of power generation on a grid.
